Process weather.gov radar to warn a given location of rain or storms

Running at https://kwynn.com/t/9/08/radar/  Fetch of new images is restricted to me, but if I have been pulling images recently (18 hours?), anyone can see the 
results.

This code pulls a weather radar image such as from https://radar.weather.gov/radar.php?rid=ffc&product=N0R&overlay=11101111&loop=no

It then processes the image relative to a given pixel / location and shows distance and direction of various intensities of rain to that location.
